### **Simple, Set-and-Forget Custom Formats**

The Dumpstarr database for Profilarr is a curated collection of **custom formats** for **Sonarr** and **Radarr**, designed to simplify sourcing high-quality, decently sized media.

**Our Focus:**
* **Simplicity:** Choose your resolution and desired audio quality (Movies only).
* **Quality Sourcing:** We use a set of formats/regex based on **Dictionarry** and **TRaSH** to better score and source your media.

### **Profile Selection Guide**

> [!TIP]
> We recommend starting with the Movies 1080p/2160p and TV 1080p/2160p profiles.

| Media Type | Profile Name | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Low-Priority Media** | `1080p LQ` | For those Movies & TV shows that your only your girlfriend will watch. |
| **Anime** | `Anime 1080p` | Anime TV and Movies |
| **TV Shows** | `TV 1080p` | 1080p |
| **4K TV Shows** | `TV 2160p` | 4K with HDR and Dolby Vision |
| **Movies** | `Movies 1080p` | Streaming Optimized 1080p |
| **4K Movies** | `Movies 2160p` | Streaming Optimized 4K with HDR and Dolby Vision. |
| **Movies (HQ Audio)** | `Movies 1080p HQ` | 1080p with a preference for HQ audio formats |
| **4K Movies (HQ Audio)** | `Movies 2160p HQ` | 4K with a preference for HQ audio formats |

> We explicitly deny x265 for resolutions lower than 2160p since these releases are usually re-encodes, for more info on this logic, see the [TRaSH Guides](https://trash-guides.info/Sonarr/sonarr-collection-of-custom-formats/#x265-hd) documentation. If you'd prefer x265 releases, you can update the score of the "**x265 (HD)**" format to **0** on the selected profile.

### **Underlying Structure and Tiers**

Our profiles are loosely based on the structure of the **SQP-1 Alternative (Radarr)** and **WEB-2160p/1080p Alternative (Sonarr)** profiles from TRaSH.

* **Release Group Tiers:** We default to the [Dictionarry](https://github.com/Dictionarry-Hub/database) group tiers (UHD, HD, 720p, WEB, Remux).
* **Alternative Groups:** The [TRaSH Guides](https://trash-guides.info/) tiers are also included if you prefer to use those instead.

### **Fixes & Features**

We include several specific fixes and features for common media-sourcing annoyances:

* **Automatic Sync** of the Dictionarry Group Tiers.
* **Parks and Recreation Fix:** Correctly sources releases from NTb.
* **Scrubs Fix:** Avoids 25fps PAL versions.
* **HONE Fix:** Prevents HONE releases from downloading when a proper release group isn't defined.
* **Whose Line Is It Anyway (US) Fix:** Targets correct releases for early seasons of the US version due to inconsistent naming.
